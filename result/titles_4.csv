For example, a model of a neighborhood bank would be relative-ly easy to validate since it could be closely ob-served. On the other hand, a model of the effec-tiveness of a naval weapons system in the year 2025 would be virtually impossible to validate completely, since the location of the battle and the nature of the enemy weapons would be un-known. Also, it is often possible to collect data on an existing system that can be used for build-ing and validating a model.

/Users/sherry/Google_Drive/transfer/subset2_4/SchRecSubset4/WSC/WSC2008/p1717-rabe.pdf,"from one modelling phase into another one. Validation in contrast aims to analyse the suitability of the model related to the given task and the sufficiently accurate modelling of the system under consideration. For both – correctness and suitability – it is characteristic that they cannot be completely proven. Therefore, the goal of V&V is not the complete and formal proof of the model validity, but the estimation of its credibility. According to Carson (1989) a model is credible, if the sponsor accepts it as appropriate for his or her decisions based on this model. As credibility is a question of acceptance, it depends on the specific persons involved. This underlines the subjective character of V&V. The aim should be to provide a systematic for this decision of acceptance, and to document it in a readable and transparent way. Only by a systematic approach and by structuring into single, directly usable sub-tasks with specific V&V techniques, V&V can be managed. Just taking the final results of a simulation study into account is a very tight limitation for V&V. Therefore, a procedure model is required that defines V&V-related activities for each single modelling step and its results.

Huizinga Department of Computer Science California State University- Fullerton Fullerton, CA 92834 dorota@ecs, fulle.rt, on. edu The wide range of applications and the ever evolving technology has made mobile computing very attractive for the researchers and practitioners. While practitioners would like to see mobile systems smaller, faster and more user friendly, the researchers need to focus on the limited bandwidth of wireless networks and its broad impact mobile application functionality. The prevailing topics of this year's ""Mobile Computing System and Application Track"" were location management and storage organization. We received the total of 13 papers, 7 of which focused on the above topics. The 26 reviewers, provided 39 evaluations (three per paper) and based on these reviews ten articles were accepted in the ""long paper"" category. Location management is the area of mobile computing that studies the ability to track mobile hosts as they move from place to place. Jie Li, Yi Pan and Xiaohua Jia propose a new analytical model for investigating movement-based location management for Personal Communication Service networks in paper ""Analysis of Dynamic Movement-Based Location Update Scheme for PCS Networks"". The authors argue that their model is more accurate then the existing methods because it accounts for Home Location Registers (HLR) and for Visitor Location Registers (VLR). Another article in this category is ""Location Management of Mobile Hosts by Grouping Pouters"" by Hiroaki Hagino, Takahiro Hara, Masahiko Tsukamoto and Shojiro Nishio. The paper describes a technique for improving the mobile communication throughput based on grouping of touters. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms already existing such as Mobile--IP. ""User Profile Replication with Caching for Distributed Location Management in Mobile Communication Networks"" by Nguyen Minh Hoang, and Harmen R. van As suggests a new model for distributed location management that focuses on two specific mechanisms: the distributed home location database and the user profile replication with caching (UPRC). The authors demonstrated through the numerical analysis that the new design is promising and that UPRC is a ""good candidate for distributed location management for the future personal communication networks"". With its numerous applications in mobile computing caching has been also used in so called ""push technology"", which relies on constant broadcasting of information from the server rather then requiring the clients to explicitly request what they need. Thus, there is a great research interest in ""broadcast disks"" and ""air-caches."" Two novel scheduling schemes for such an air cache in a system with multiple channels are proposed in paper ""A Generalized Air-Cache Design for Efficient Broadcasting on Multiple Physical Channels"" by Duc A. Tran, Kien A. Hua and Ning Jiang. Similarly the authors of ""Adaptive Semantic Data Broadcast in a Mobile Environment"", Ken Chi Keung Lee, Hong Va Leong, and Antonio Si, propose two new algorithms ""static hierarchical chunking"" and ""adaptive hierarchical chunking"" for semantic data broadcast in a mobile environment. The article also shows effectiveness of the new techniques 366
