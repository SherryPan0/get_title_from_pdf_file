This finding agreed with diSessa’s (2004) findings that suggest that kids do similar things to what professionals do and some things that differ. During the production, interpretation, and critique of sound representations, the boys were found to focus on similar aspects of sound as professional architects (White, 2004), such as sound location, sound intensity, and sound generator. The boys’ representations differed from those used by architects primarily through the category of “sound type.” Architects (White, 2004) utilized conventional symbols for sound, despite the type of sound, while the boys varied their symbols based on the type of the sound (i.e., notes for sounds coming from a parade, letters/words for sounds coming from children playing, and sound waves for the sounds coming from cars and airplanes).

This work was supported by the Brain Korea 21 Project.
