Box 7, Mu'tah, Karak 61710, Jordan E-mail: omari~mutah.edu.io Key Words- Routing, Interconnection Networks, Tree-Hypercube, Hypercube ABSTRACT This research focuses on developing optimal point- to-point routing algorithm for quad Tree-Hypercube networks (TITs). TH's have been introducad as new fixed interconnection networks. It was shown that they have many hypercube features such as self-routing. In addition, they have advantages over hypercubes in extendibility, diameter, and average distant. In this research, an optimal point-to-point routing algorithm will be presented for quad TITs. It will be shown that the time for routing messages between any two nodes in the network is in the order of 2k, where 2k is the diameter of the network. In addition, the parallel path property in quad Tree-Hypercubes will be studied and the number ofparaUei shortest paths will be computed. 1. INTRODUCTION Highly parallel systems have attracted increasing interest in recent years. The number of processors that form multiprocessor system could scale up to thousands of processors. The inter-processor communication in these systems is based on message passing. The design of efficient routing algorithms has received significant attention due to its importance to high performance in multiprocessor systems 2, 10, 11, 12. Many applications that run on multiprocessor systems depend highly on communication time. Examples of such applications include sorting, matrix computations, parallel prefix, and FFT. One of the primary functions in a multiprocessor network is the routing of messages between pairs of
